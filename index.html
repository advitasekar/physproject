            <p> I am a Senior Data Scientist at ClimaPredict Innovations, a global research institution that makes predictive models about the impact of climate change. Through my academic journey, I have always been interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and this position gave me the opportunity to utilize my skills to make a difference and spread awareness about the disastrous consequences of global warming. At this institution, we build models with high accuracy to predict the impacts of climate change on agriculture, infrastructure, marine life, and other sectors. Our models process datasets from satellites, previous weather records, and climate sensors and it also has access to the internet, feeding it with various resources about trends associated with the climate. Using this information, it forecasts extreme weather events, allowing preparation by warning people about the potential consequences of climate change. This information is critical for communities to begin strategizing about how to mitigate climate change effectively. My role at this company is to maintain the accuracy of the models, make the required updates to the models, and to collaborate with organizations fighting climate change in order to ensure our models are highly accurate and practical.

            <p>I am a lifetime climate activist that works with Earth Justice as well as other smaller organizations in my community. I have always had a passion for activism and after taking some classes in my undergraduate at University of California San Diego, it made me realize that if we donâ€™t push for change and action then nothing will ever change. So immediately after I graduated I chose to work with Earth justice and continue to grow my knowledge on what we can do to lower greenhouse gas emissions and try and fix our suffering planet. This career that I have chosen is not one that is conventional or easy but I now have a family of my own and I want them to be able to thrive in our world 50 years from now. At EarthJustice I mostly work with our legal team working to push the ideas of effective ways to get our representatives in office to push for carbon taxes so that we can try and lower emissions in the future. </p>

            <h2>Sandra Garcia</h2>
            <p>As a public health major in college, I was never into taking science courses like physics. During my senior year, I decided to take a course that merged something I was passionate about and had learned about in other courses which was environmental health with physics. There I learned about climate change and the factors making it all happen. After graduating, I decided to pursue a career that allowed these two interests to intersect and landed me a job working for the Department of Energy. This allowed me to pursue a career that involved conducting researching regarding the impacts of using nonrenewable sources for energy such as burning fossil fuels not only on health and safety from the air we breathe to living in an environment free of potential risks involving nuclear plants and radiation after reading about previous research being done by the National Cancer Institute as they studied different groups of people and even included people who were exposed after the Chernobyl accident that occurred back in 1986. I now mainly work on projects that involve researching how clean energy sources differ and impact population health.</p>
